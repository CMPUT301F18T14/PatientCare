# PicMyMed

PicMyMed is an Android application that allows patients to create health problems that they may upload multiple records to in order to track progression of a health condition. Have a mole that you're considered about? Create a problem and upload photo records over time to track visual changes! Care providers may monitor their patients health records and upload their own comments to patient's health problems. 

Check out the project wiki for a more detailed overview of PicMyMed.
