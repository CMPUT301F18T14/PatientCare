# PicMyMed

PicMyMed is an Android application that allows patients to track the progression of their health problems by uploading records. Have a mole that you're concerned about? Create a problem and upload photo records over time to track visual changes! Care providers may monitor their patients' health records and upload their own comments to patients' health problems. 

Check out the project wiki for a more detailed overview of PicMyMed.
